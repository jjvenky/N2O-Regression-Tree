N2O-Regression-Tree
===================

Data and code associated with Venkiteswaran, Rosamond, and Schiff manuscript titled *Non-linear response of riverine N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes to oxygen and temperature*.

This manuscript was submitted to *Environmental Science & Technology* on 17 July 2013 as *es-2013-03191z*. The raw data and R-script used to perform the analyses and figures will be placed here. They will also be offered to the journal to be included as SI material.

The raw data is a csv file.

The R-code requires ggplot2, GGally, mvpart, rpart, and rpart.plot.

Files to come once I confirm that *ES&T* will accept the data and code being on github and acs.org at the same time.
